Android-Midterm
===============

Basic app to display current movie info from Rotten Tomatoes:
  *It's just an old midterm project from Mobile Applications class as an entry-level resume code example.*
  The target was SDK of 17 with minimum of 11 to display on 3.2" QVGA(ADP2) (320x480: mdpi).
  *I haven't been able to get any Android simulator running on my remaining aging cheapo desktop, so this is a non-running example for the foreseeable future...*
  
  My (Android specific) java code is everything *but Config.java* in the zip under /Midterm/src/com/example/midterm/
  Most of my XML is under /Midterm/res/layout/ with some modifications to /Midterm/AndroidManifest.xml
  
  "Favorites" related functions don't currently work without the original teacher's server.
    This'd require setting up my own public database server, so they're currently just commented out.
