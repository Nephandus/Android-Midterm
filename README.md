Android-Midterm
===============

Basic app to display Rotten Tomatoes-based movie reviews:
  *It's just an old midterm project from Mobile Applications class as an entry-level resume code example.*
  The target was SDK of 17 with minimum of 11 to display on 3.2" QVGA(ADP2) (320x480: mdpi).
  
  Issues:
    "Favorites" related functions don't currently work without the original teacher's database.
      This'd require setting up my own database online so will probably just remain commented out.
    As of SDK 19, scrolling through movies on any list jumps to then sticks at the bottom for some reason.
      This I'll try to fix, if possible.
